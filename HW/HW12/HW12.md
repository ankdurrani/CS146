We can solve this problem using Kruskal's algorithm. First, create an Edge class that intializes pointers so we can navigate the graph bidirectionally as stated by the problem. Then, you can use a handy algorithm called union-find to call back to the parent node if needed. Then, for the main problem, we can solve this using Kruskal's algorithm. We store the edge nodes from the graph into a List, including the zero cost wells and pipes. It's best to sort the List in ascending order so we know what the lowest values are easily, then we can iterate with a loop to see if any cycles are found, as this means we can find a better minimum cost to supply water.
