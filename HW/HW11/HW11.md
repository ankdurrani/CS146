To solve this problem, you can begin by initializing the oldColor variable to the first pixel in the image array. Next, perform a DFS (depth-first search) to fill the array recursively. In the case that the color doesn't match, return without changing the value. Continues until all pixels of the same color have been updated to the new color. 

An edge case to iron out for this problem was a situation in which an image array is empty, or the first pixel already matches the requirements of having the new color. You can simply check for this early and return the image as is before committing to unnecessary operations.
